### Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- The current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.

### Expected behaviour
- First-level comments should be ordered by their score, whereas nested replies are ordered by time added.
- Replying to a comment adds the new reply to the bottom of the nested replies within that comment.
- A confirmation modal should pop up before a comment or reply is deleted.
- You can only edit or delete your own comments and replies.
